Hey everyone! 👋

I'm Jared Rodriguez Vargas, and I'm a student studying Digital Networks and Cybersecurity Engineering at the Technological University of Cancun 🎓. I love tech 💻 and I'm stoked to be here to learn and grow in my field.

In this repo, you'll find some of the projects I've done during my time in uni 🚀. These projects show off my skills in designing and implementing network security solutions, and managing computer systems.

Throughout my studies, I've picked up some sick skills in problem-solving, programming, data analysis, and project management 🤓. And, I stay up-to-date on the latest trends and techniques in cybersecurity to keep digital networks secure and information safe 🔒.
